# Progress: CREIQ

## Current Status
The CREIQ project has successfully implemented the following components:

1. **Roll Number Processing** ✅
   - CSV file parsing and roll number extraction
   - Roll number cleaning and validation
   - URL generation from roll numbers

2. **URL Fetching** ✅
   - HTTP request handling with retry logic
   - Error management and logging
   - Content storage in JSON format

3. **Project Structure** ✅
   - Organized package structure
   - CLI implementation
   - Documentation
   - Basic testing

4. **Data Extraction** ✅
   - HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
   - Property information extraction
   - Appeals list extraction
   - Appeal detail extraction with structured data format
   - Organized data structure with proper categorization

5. **Database Storage** ✅
   - SQLAlchemy ORM implementation
   - Database models for all entities
   - Data storage and retrieval operations
   - CLI commands for database operations
   - Integration with main workflow

## What Works

### Roll Number Processing
- Reading roll numbers from CSV files
- Cleaning and formatting roll numbers
- Generating URLs with base URL from environment variables

### URL Fetching
- Fetching content from URLs with configurable retries and timeouts
- Handling network errors gracefully
- Saving fetched content to JSON files
- Multiple fetching modes (single URL, multiple URLs)

### HTML Parsing and Data Extraction
- Parsing property information from HTML content
- Extracting appeals list with all relevant fields
- Fetching and parsing appeal detail pages
- Organizing appeal details into structured sections (property_information and appellant_information)
- Handling variations in HTML content

### Database Integration
- SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Models for Properties, Appeals, AppealDetails, Representatives, and Hearings
- Database initialization and table creation
- Data storage from parsed JSON
- Querying by roll number, appeal number, and status
- Eager loading of related entities to prevent DetachedInstanceError

### Command Line Interface
- Basic CLI with argument parsing
- Support for different operations (print, fetch, parse)
- Database commands (init, store, query, export)
- Configuration options (CSV file, output file, timeout, retries)

### Interactive Mode
- Interactive script via main.py
- User prompts for actions
- File saving options
- Complete workflow automation (fetch, parse, store in database)

## What's Left to Build

### Database Optimization
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Caching mechanisms

### Reporting Functionality
- Statistical reporting on appeal data
- Summary reports by category
- Data visualization

### Advanced Features
- Pagination handling
- Authentication for restricted websites
- Change monitoring
- Web interface

## Known Issues
- No rate limiting implemented yet
- No handling for website structure changes
- Limited error recovery for malformed HTML
- No support for authentication
- Testing coverage is limited

## Evolution of Decisions

### Project Structure
Originally started as a simple script, evolved into a proper Python package structure with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design
- Package installation capability
- Command-line interface
- Database integration module

### Database Design
Initial plan was to store raw data, but evolved to a comprehensive relational model:
- SQLAlchemy ORM for data mapping
- Multiple interrelated tables for proper data normalization
- Clear relationship definitions between entities
- Flexible query capabilities

### Error Handling
Evolved from basic exception handling to a comprehensive approach:
- Multiple retry attempts for transient errors
- Detailed logging
- Graceful degradation
- Session management in database operations
- Eager loading to prevent relationship errors

### Interface Design
Started with a simple script interface, now includes:
- Command-line argument parsing
- Interactive prompts
- Programmatic API
- Configuration via environment variables
- Database command subparsers

### Data Extraction Strategy
Initial approach was to simply store raw HTML, but evolved to:
- Structured parsing using BeautifulSoup
- Hierarchical data organization
- Separation of property and appellant information
- Detailed logging of parsing operations
- Optional fetching of appeal details to manage performance
- Database storage of extracted data
