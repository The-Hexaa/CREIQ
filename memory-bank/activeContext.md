# Active Context: CREIQ

## Current Focus
The current focus of the CREIQ project is on refinement and optimization of the database integration after successfully implementing the SQLite database backend. We have:

1. Implemented database models using SQLAlchemy ORM for all data entities
2. Created a robust DatabaseManager class to handle all database operations
3. Integrated database operations into the CLI and main workflow
4. Fixed issues with SQLAlchemy's session handling for relationship queries
5. Structured the entire workflow to automatically populate the database with parsed data

The next phase involves optimizing the database queries and implementing additional reporting features.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM models for properties, appeals, appeal details, representatives, and hearings
- Created a DatabaseManager class with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Added CLI commands for database initialization, storage, and querying
- Fixed a DetachedInstanceError by implementing eager loading with joinedload()
- Updated main.py to perform the complete workflow and automatically store data in the database
- Enhanced error handling for database operations with proper logging

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Database Optimization**
   - Optimize query performance for large datasets
   - Implement database indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Add caching mechanisms for repeated queries

2. **Reporting Features**
   - Implement statistical reporting on appeal data
   - Create summary reports by status, representative, or time period
   - Add data visualization capabilities

3. **Data Maintenance**
   - Implement data update mechanisms for refreshing existing records
   - Add data validation and cleaning functionality
   - Create data archiving solutions

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement pagination handling for properties with many appeals
2. Add authentication support for restricted websites
3. Create a monitoring system for tracking changes in appeal status
4. Develop a simple web interface for viewing the database contents

## Active Decisions

### Database Schema Implementation
- Implemented a relational schema with the following tables:
  - Properties (roll_number as primary key)
  - Appeals (appeal_number as primary key, with foreign key to properties)
  - AppealDetails (with foreign key to appeals)
  - Representatives (with many-to-many relationship with appeals)
  - Hearings (with foreign key to appeals)

### SQLAlchemy ORM Approach
- Using SQLAlchemy's declarative base for model definitions
- Implementing proper relationships between models with bidirectional relationships
- Using eager loading to prevent DetachedInstanceError when accessing related objects
- Making related fields nullable where appropriate for partial data

### Database Access Layer
- Created a DatabaseManager class to encapsulate all database operations
- Implementing session management with context managers for proper resource cleanup
- Using environment variables for database configuration
- Supporting flexible querying by various criteria (roll number, appeal number, status)

### Testing Strategy
- Testing database operations with sample data
- Implementing integration tests for the end-to-end workflow
- Adding validation checks for data integrity

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- Clear class and method names following PEP 8
- Comprehensive docstrings using Google style
- Single responsibility principle for all classes
- Type hints for better code documentation

### Error Handling
- Catch specific exceptions rather than general ones
- Provide clear error messages with context
- Proper session management to prevent SQLAlchemy errors
- Log database operations with appropriate severity levels

### Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for database connection configuration
- Default to SQLite for simplicity with path configurable via environment
- Make configuration easily overridable for different environments

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Database Integration
- SQLAlchemy provides a robust ORM layer for working with relational databases
- Proper session management is crucial to prevent DetachedInstanceError
- Eager loading with joinedload() is an effective way to load related objects
- Making fields nullable is important when working with partially available data

### SQLite Advantages
- SQLite provides a simple, file-based database solution that doesn't require a server
- SQLAlchemy abstracts the database dialect, making it easy to switch to PostgreSQL later
- The same ORM models can be used regardless of the underlying database engine

### Data Migration Considerations
- Implemented a flexible data loading approach that can handle various JSON structures
- Date parsing needs to be robust to handle various formats
- Duplicate detection and updating is important for refreshing data

### Challenges Addressed
- Fixed DetachedInstanceError by implementing eager loading with joinedload()
- Handled various date formats with a flexible date parser
- Implemented proper session management for database operations
- Created a comprehensive DatabaseManager class to encapsulate all database operations
