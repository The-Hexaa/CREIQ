# Project Brief: CREIQ

## Project Overview
CREIQ (Consolidated Real Estate Information Query) is a Python application designed to process roll numbers from a CSV file, generate URLs by combining these roll numbers with a base URL, and fetch content from these URLs. The project follows a modular structure with clean code principles.

## Core Requirements

1. **Roll Number Processing**
   - Read roll numbers from a CSV file
   - Process and clean the roll numbers

2. **URL Generation**
   - Combine roll numbers with a base URL from environment variables
   - Generate complete URLs for each roll number

3. **Web Content Fetching**
   - Fetch web content from generated URLs
   - Handle retries, timeouts, and errors gracefully
   - Store the fetched content

4. **Content Analysis**
   - Parse and analyze the fetched content
   - Extract structured data from the HTML responses
   - Store data in a database

## Technical Goals

1. Maintain clean, modular code structure
2. Follow Object-Oriented Programming principles
3. Provide both command-line and programmatic interfaces
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Maintain comprehensive documentation
6. Include automated tests

## Project Scope
The scope of this project is limited to:
- Processing roll numbers from CSV files
- Generating URLs and fetching content
- Storing and analyzing fetched content
- Storing extracted data in a database

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful when:
- It can reliably process roll numbers and generate URLs
- It can fetch content from multiple URLs with proper error handling
- It extracts and stores structured data from the fetched content
- It provides intuitive interfaces for users
- The code is well-documented and tested
